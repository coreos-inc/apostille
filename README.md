# Apostille

Quay's Image Metadata Signature Service

Apostille acts similarly to a [notary server](https://github.com/docker/notary) in order to support clients using Docker
Content Trust. However, Apostille can expose different chains of trust to clients, and supports non-DCT clients with
additional signing features.
